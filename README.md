# Main page for my website

You can find all of the projects i make on this website. I will link the project page and repository with each project.

## Pong With Artificial Intelligence:
  This project consists of a simple pong engine that has 2 artificial intelligences within it. The choice named Dumb AI simply matches the y coordinate of its paddle to the y coordinate of the ball. The AI named Smart AI calculates the trajectory of the ball, and then places its paddle as close to the predicted point of contact as possible. You can find the project page [here](https://github.com/pastachilli/Pong-w-AI), and the demo for the project [here](https://pastachilli.github.io/Pong-w-AI/).

## Double Pendilum:
  This project consists of a double pendilum simulation that was influenced by the youtube channel Code Bullet's video on double pendilums. This is the formula I used to calculate the angular velocity of both balls

  There are also numerous sliders and buttons that you can use to interact with the program. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/pastachilli/Double-Pendilum), and the demo for the project [here](https://pastachilli.github.io/Double-Pendilum/).
